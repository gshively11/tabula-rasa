The ever-increasing capabilities and prevalence of robots present a myriad of fascinating questions about the impact robotic technologies will have on human society. Robots are being utilized in more and more areas formerly controlled exclusively by humans, from manufacturing to healthcare to domestic service. This shift may eventually cause a paradigm shift in the labor force, with humans needing to re-evaluate their skill set and place in the labor market. This profound transition has the potential to drastically alter the economic structure of society, with the advent of a more decentralized approach to labor and a new wave of economic opportunities. <br/><br/>On the other hand, robotics technology presents an opportunity to empower those members of society that may have been previously left behind. Disabled individuals, for instance, can benefit from robotic aide and its ever-increasing potential. Robotics technology could also provide much-needed relief to those in poverty-stricken or war-torn environments, allowing for humanitarian projects to be deployed in efficient and effective manners. <br/><br/>Whichever direction robotics takes us, it is clear that the impact of robotics on our lives and society as a whole will be felt for generations to come. It will be incredibly exciting — and perhaps a bit unsettling — to watch these changes unfold.
