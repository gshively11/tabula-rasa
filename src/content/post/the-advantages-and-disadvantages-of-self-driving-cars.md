Self-driving cars have come a long way in terms of development, and are no longer a work of science fiction. While they offer several benefits such as efficient traffic flow, improved road safety and reduced stress levels, they also pose certain risks to society involving loss of control, data security and the need for their cost optimization.<br/><br/>One of the most revolutionary things self-driving cars can ensure is greater road safety. With autonomous vehicles, computers take over responsibility for driving, eliminating the risks of driver errors or human negligence behind the wheel. When we couple hazards like driving under influence, putting them behind the movable bulb of modern automation is like making the roads more welcoming.<br/><br/>However, we should not forget that these high-tech cars can also capture market control in the competitive industry while disregarding the employment of drivers, becoming perpetrators of unwanted break-ins, security breaching and theft cracks. With control switching from humans to supercomputers in a so-called cost-effective way, losing governance for preference can risk the real liberation we gained from the initial automotive era.
