As we enter the season of spring, I am filled with excitement at the prospect of longer days and warmer weather. It's a time to shed the layers of winter and embrace the world with a fresh perspective. From picnics in the park to leisurely walks in the sunshine, there is so much to look forward to in the coming months. I am grateful for the beauty that surrounds me and the opportunity to experience all that spring has to offer.
