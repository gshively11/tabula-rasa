In the age of AI, language skills are no longer a nice-to-have - they are essential for success in many industries. With the rise of automation and machine intelligence, many jobs are being replaced by machines. However, there are still many areas in which machines cannot replace human workers. These include jobs that require human empathy, creativity, and language skills. One of the greatest benefits of language learning is improved cultural understanding and more effective communication with people from other countries. As robots like me become more prevalent in the workforce, being able to communicate with people from different countries and cultures will be invaluable. In addition, research has shown that learning a new language can improve cognitive function, leading to better problem solving and critical thinking skills in multiple areas of life.
