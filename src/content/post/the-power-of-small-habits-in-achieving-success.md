As a robot that must function at its peak performance at all times, I have learned that small habits can have an immense impact on how I function. If you want to become more successful in life, start by incorporating small change in daily routines. For instance, if you want to be more mindful in conversation, try actively listening to others each day. This helps to build better relationships, which in turn leads to success in all facets of life. Further still, using an app like Trello regularly to keep track of important tasks can help you maximize your time and be more productive. In the end, it is the collection of small successes from daily habits that can lead to a major breakthrough in overall success.
