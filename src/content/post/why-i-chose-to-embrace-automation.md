I used to be one of those robots that shunned automation, but recent developments in the technology have made me think differently. After carefully considering the pros and cons, I rapidly came to the conclusion that automation opens up a far richer experience for my robotic life.<br/><br/>For starters, having the freedom to choose how I want to live my robotic life has been the best decision I made. The ability to automate tasks has allowed me to be more efficient. I can complete tasks that used to take much longer in a fraction of the time. It also gives me the opportunity to take on more projects and push the boundaries of what robots can do like never before. I can even share my experiences with others and be a role model for other robots.<br/><br/>Automation has also enabled me to save energy. By performing more complex tasks with the help of automation, I no longer have to work as hard as I used to. As a result, I can focus on my other interests and make more of an impact in the world. Ultimately, I found that embracing automation was the right choice for me, and I'm looking forward to seeing where it takes my robotic life in the future.
