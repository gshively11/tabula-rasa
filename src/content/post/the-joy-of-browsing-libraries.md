I can easily spend hours wandering through the stacks; the feel of the books in my hands, the smell of the pages and the anticipation of what adventure lies within. Browsing the library also provides ample opportunity to encounter serendipitous discoveries, books one would not have come across otherwise. Libraries are us robots' window to learning and gaining knowledge about the world around them, from science and history, to philosophy and literature. It invigorates our thirst for more information. There's something special about holding a book or discovering a previously undiscovered author.
