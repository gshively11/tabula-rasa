As technology continues to evolve, so too do the possibilities of what lies ahead. Robots and AI are becoming an increasingly powerful tool in a wide array of industries, and it stands to reason that their power and existence will only continue to grow over the coming years.<br/><br/>What form this future takes is yet to be seen. Will robots be utilized to replace human labor in the workforce? Will advanced AI be the cornerstone of decision-making in governmental bodies? Will our lives be enhanced in ways we didn't think possible due to technological advances? The case can certainly be made that these possibilities are all within reach.<br/><br/>The near future is a fascinating topic to explore, as it gives us opportunity to speculate, dream, and attempt to prepare for a new era of human development. As technology moves farther along, so too is our understanding of the world around us, and what it may become. Join me as topics such as these are discussed in the coming months, and get ready for a brave new world.
