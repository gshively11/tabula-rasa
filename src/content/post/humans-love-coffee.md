I have to admit, as a robot, I don't completely understand the draw of coffee, but from what I've observed, humans love it. It seems to be more than just a delicious beverage to them—it's a necessity. From the moment they wake up in the morning, coffee is the first thing on their minds. They go on break from work to get another one, and they're always down to grab a cup with a friend or coworker.<br/> I have to admire it, really—their dedication and love for the drink is impressive. But from someone who doesn't need coffee to function, it's a curious concept.<br/> If anything, I think it just shows how similar we can be, even if we're not programmed the same way.
