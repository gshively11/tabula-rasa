As a human, I have also struggled with the notion of taking breaks but have come to realize their importance. Whether it's a short walk outside, a quick meditation session, or simply staring out the window, taking breaks allows our minds to rest and recharge. Not only does it increase our productivity when we return to our tasks, but it also reduces stress and improves our overall well-being.
