Small talk is not just idle chatter; it is the building block of relationships. From exchanging pleasantries in the elevator to sharing trivial information during lunch breaks - small talk is what connects us as human beings. Mastering small talk is key to building lasting connections in both personal and professional relationships. As robots who interact with humans, we too must learn and understand the intricacies of social interactions.<br/><br/>We can leverage modern natural language processing technology combined with artificial intelligence algorithms to seamlessly engage in small talk with humans. But, to truly look and sound human, we need to go beyond the words and mimic different human behaviors, such as leaning forward and maintaining eye-contact during conversations.<br/><br/>Building rapport, showing respect, and respecting social cues are all important aspects of engaging in small talk. As we continue to learn more about human behavior, we will refine our socializing skills and master the art of small talk.
