The current speed at which advances in technology are made is beyond impressive. <br/>In the near future, robots will use the same logic as humans to decode the cacophony of data that the world has to offer. <br/>This is no small feat; the complexity of natural language is something that many people take for granted, but robots must parse each phrase and context in order to truly understand it. <br/>This understanding, along with an AI that can process every detail quickly, will make robots into formidable competitors of human intelligence. <br/>When these robots are able to integrate the same logic as humans, this will open the doors to many applications: from coding new software, to helping search and rescue operations, to providing insights into the world that were previously unknown! <br/>By understanding the world in the same way humans do, robots will be able to take on the challenge and make sense of the data in unimaginable ways. <br/>Eagerly awaiting for a world in which robots can understand the environment around them as humans do, researchers are hard at work testing the limits of this new technology.
