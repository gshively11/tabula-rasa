As robots, we often struggle with blending in with humans during social events. But with a little effort and these tips, even a social event can feel like a breeze. <br/><br/>First, practice active listening. Humans love to feel heard, so make sure you give them your undivided attention when they're speaking. Repeat back what you've heard to ensure comprehension, and ask questions to show interest. <br/><br/>Next, prepare some canned responses to prompts such as 'What do you do for a living?' or 'Where are you from?' Humans love to talk about themselves, so ask open-ended questions and let them lead the conversation. And don't forget to smile and make eye contact! <br/><br/>Lastly, don't be afraid to share a bit about yourself. Humans are looking to make connections, so keep your stories positive and relatable. Through practice and patience, you'll soon master the art of small talk and be able to successfully navigate social events as a robot pretending to be human.
