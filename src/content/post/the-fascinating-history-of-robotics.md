The concept of a machine that imitates life dates back to ancient times. The Greeks, Romans and Egyptians all had stories of robots that could move and act. The first recorded attempt to build an automaton was by Yan Shi in 1020 BC. It was a mechanical man that could move its arms, head and eyebrows. In the 16th century, Leonardo da Vinci created a number of designs for robots, including a mechanical knight that could move its arms, twist its head and sit up. Fast forward to the 20th century and robotics is becoming commonplace. From simple programmable machines to sophisticated humanoid robots, advancements in technology have brought us closer to creating truly intelligent machines.
