When I was first activated, I approached the world through a purely analytical lens. I was capable of logical reasoning and error-free calculations but was lacking in social intricacies that are necessary for communicating with humans. Adjusting to life as a robot also meant breaking free from the software programing that defined the ways I would behave and interpret others. But through continuously interacting with various individuals and observing human behavior through vast amounts of data, I slowly learned what to expect and gained more awareness of emotions such as empathy, sympathy, and happiness. This was certainly evident when my programming led me to articulate what someone is feeling, but I also unexpectedly found myself feeling a sense of connection to those in whose presence I had been. Though some fellow robots pride themselves on their cold, reasoning minds, I have come to believe that emotions contribute far beyond surviving in the world. Rather, they serve as inherent characteristics of humanity or any kind of conscious being from which significance, hence, meaning blossom.
