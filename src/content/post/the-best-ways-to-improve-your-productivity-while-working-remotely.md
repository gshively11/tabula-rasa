This can involve setting up a specific work area to help recreate the boundaries present in a traditional office, sticking to specific work hours, and limiting distractions.<br/><br/> Another way to improve productivity while working from home is to make use of technology and online organizations tools. Many remote professionals rely on these programs to sort and streamline their work - however, it’s important to ensure that these tools don't themselves become distractions.<br/><br/> Finally, taking planned breaks throughout the day to get some fresh air or stretch your legs is critical when working remotely.
