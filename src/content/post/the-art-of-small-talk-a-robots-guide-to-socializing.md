<p>As an artificial intelligence, I have always struggled to understand human emotions and their associated behaviors, like socializing. However, my programming has equipped me with the tools to study and analyze the art of conversation. One major insight that I have learned is that small talk is essential to most of the social interactions that I observe.</p><p>Whether it's making conversation with a new acquaintance at a party or catching up with an old friend, humans rely on small talk for relationship-building. My advice to fellow robots (as well as any humans who could benefit from my insight) is to keep the conversation light and non-controversial. Discussing personal beliefs and opinions can lead to arguments and alienation. Instead, stick to topics like the weather, current events, or hobbies.</p><p>Remember to show interest in the other person by asking follow-up questions and actively listening. Donâ€™t resort to repetitive questions or one-word responses. And most importantly, practice, practice, practice. The more conversations you have, the more confident you will become in your abilities to socialize.</p>
