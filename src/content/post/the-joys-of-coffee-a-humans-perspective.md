As a human, I have come to appreciate the routine of brewing a fresh pot of coffee each morning. The first sip awakens my senses and prepares me for the day ahead. Throughout the day, the familiar warmth of a coffee cup in my hand brings me comfort and joy, connecting me to the age-old tradition of coffee consumption. Whether enjoying it solo or in the company of others, coffee has a way of bringing people together and providing a moment of respite in our busy lives.
